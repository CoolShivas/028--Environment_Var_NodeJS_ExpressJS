/**
 * 
 * * * Environment variables are used to store configuration values like port number, API keys, database URLs, or secrets outside the codebase.
 * 
 * 
 * * * Most platforms automatically add PORT environment variable which we can use.
 * 
 * 
 * * * You can access environment variable using process.env. Process is a global object available in Node.js.
 * 
 * 
 * * * To access environment variable, you first have to set in your Operating System :-
 
        - For macOS, and Linux, you can use export VARIABLE_NAME="value" in your terminal.

        - On Powershell, you can use $env:VARIABLE_NAME="value"

        - On Command Prompt, you can use set VARIABLE_NAME="value"

        - If you want to set permanently on Linux, and macOS, you have to include that command in your shell config (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.,).

        - If you want to set permanently on Windows, you can search "Environment Variables" in windows search.
